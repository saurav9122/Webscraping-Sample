0,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent low oil cooking with a cumbersome cleaning,"  Really nice device for low oil cooking. Made chicken, samosa, fries, potato wedges and panneer tikka. The food comes really tasty just like normal cooking. Read comments that the wire is too small but for the given length I feel it's more than enough. If you are cooking multiple items like fish which occupies more space then you need a airfryer double layer grill. Don't over fill the grill otherwise the food will get stick to each other. The airfryer is basically a dehydrator so don't compare it with an conventional oven. It is not completely oil free cooking too, you will need some little spray of oil to make the food non sticky to the grill. The philips app is really useful with the Indian recipes and steps/temperature  to follow. The best I've seen is the tiffin box briyani! Worth it! The only con is cleaning the inside of the grill. You need to soak and clean it with a brush to remove the sticky minute food left on the girll and corners. Bought on prime day sale for 8.3k",138 people found this helpful
1,Sur,5.0 out of 5 stars,You don't know what you are missing,  1. You will never have to worry about cleaning the kitchen after you fry fish. ( They splatter everywhere. You know it....)2. You will need one dime of oil instead of a wok full to fry potatoes ( you will never ever buy McDonald's French fries again) nobody will know that it's air fried and not dip fried. It reduced my oil consumption of 3lt per month to 1lt for a family of 6.3. If you are busy woman and needs multi tasking then this is a worthy investment. You don't need to watch over it. Just put everything in and it will cook according to the time and pings when done. It reduced my cooking time by 1.5 hours.4. You can try from simple French fries to chicken tandoori and all will be delicious and that too with very less oil.,92 people found this helpful
2,Sathish,1.0 out of 5 stars,Defective item received - Twice !!,"  Bought it for around Rs 9200 when there was a Lightning deal which was also accompanied by a Cashback.Item was delivered the next day, but it had a defect - Tray when opened couldn’t be closed completely due to a loose part in the Tray compartment which was obstructing Tray closure. Thanks to Amazon’s replacement policy, I opted for replacement and I could get the defective item replaced in just a couple of days.However, the replaced item had severe defects - Its power light doesn’t turn ON, there’s a weird noise from the Fryer and the food item (fries) just gets mildly warm (I.e., it doesn’t get fried) even after 15 minutes with 200 degrees temperature.Only option left was to return the item (thanks to Return policy !)After purchasing the product at a competitive price with an additional Cashback and a replacement, I ended up returning the item.This has been my worst ever purchase from Amazon - I wonder what’s wrong with Quality Assurance at Philips.",88 people found this helpful

4,Milothian,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed Buy,"  I have been researching for a good air fryer for my in-laws as a healthier options for them to prepared some of the India treats and snacks. However, I was highly disappointed in this product as it was very time consuming to use and the fan was very loud. I read multiple reviews and selected this model thinking it was good quality based on what I read. Unfortunately, my mother-in-law will never use this again and it was passed the return window and so she can't request a return and try another model. Considering it was a Phillip brand, we expected better quality. The food was unevenly cooked and it took almost 6 hours to fry some pakoras. Maybe we received a malfunction model, but since we can't request a replacement or return, we will never know. Please do not buy!",26 people found this helpful
5,Aditya Jaitak,5.0 out of 5 stars,Impressive product !!!,"  Received the product in a brown cardboard box with Philips tape. Upon opening the box, another box with Philips branding contained the air fryer. This ensured that I received a brand new product.Cooked some McCain products for the first demonstration to my family. The snacks came out well cooked and tasted good. Oil brushing would be required for homemade dishes.Good product overall.",18 people found this helpful
6,A Majumder,3.0 out of 5 stars,i found it difficult to clean.,"  the taste and softness of the cooked food is much more than my expectation . but i found it difficult in the following aspects.1. difficulty in cleaning the net tray. the net tray is fixed with the box. it should be detachable. food residue stuck in the tray which can not comes out easily.2. Airfryer should have button for start/stop or pause like microwave. if is very disappointing that once you fix the timer you cant stop it or pause it to check the cooking status. moreover,  once you fix the timer you cant reduce the time even where the food cooked before time.  only main power cut can stop the machine.",14 people found this helpful
7,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,My mother loves it!,"  Gifted this to my mother. She was reluctant to use it first as she is used to the usual frying process. But as she got used to it, she loved it! She still thanks me for this (even after 2 years) because this has made her life so much easier. Some yummy snacks can be made in this air fryer with minimal effort. It's especially great if guests are coming over and you quickly want to prepare snacks. Amazing product! And Philips is better than other brands in this category.",16 people found this helpful
